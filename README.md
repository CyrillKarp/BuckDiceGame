Buck Dice is a dice game that is simple, quick, and rather addictive. It is an elimination game â€“ the last player left is the loser. It is often used as a bar game. This game is played by two players. It is played with three dice. 

The game begins with the computer determine the "point" for the game.

The game then proceeds with each player, in turn, rolling three three dice, and continuing to roll as long as each roll produces at least one point.

Scoring is as follows:

One point for each dice that matches the player's point.
Fifteen points if the player rolls a three-of-a-kind of the point value. This is known as a "Big Buck".
Five points if the player rolls a three-of-a-kind of any non-point value. This is known as a "Little Buck".
As soon as a player makes a roll that scores no points, the turn passes to the next player (making sure to keep a running total of the score for the each player).

As soon as a player reaches 15 points or more, he won!
